# ForgetMeNot
Calendar app on windows &amp; android platform allowing to add tasks, events. Everything is synchronised.

The purpose of this application is to make system which allow user to add meetings/tasks on every possible platform 
- by computer (windows, maybe linux in the future)
- by telephone (android, ios)
- by website

Just one person is responsible for every aspect of this application so as you can assume creating the whole system can take looooong time (by long I mean even a YEAR).
Till the end of the August 2019 I would like to present you working prototypes of each part of this system. It won't be easy for me because I'm doing it in my free time which I don't have too much (full time studies, part-time work).

The first part of the system which I'm creating is Windows Application (Windows Forms). I've done many small WPF projects but I think that finally the time has come for Windows Forms, then I would switch to Xamarin and finally to ASP.NET. Feel free to ask any questions or suggest ideas.

Implemented things:
- basic UI,
- showing user's main calendar,
- basic communicatan with Google API

In progress:
- adding new event to calendar defined by user,
- deleting events,

Unimplemented things
- editing existing events,
- prettier UI,
- basic user settings (like defining color of calendar's events, specifing if we want notifications (via mail/desktop)
